ok, this one is wrong because I somehow assumed that the lower digits of 2^x when x was really high would approach the lower digits of 2^7830457 .... yeah, its that bad. Instead, what I need to do is preserve the lower digits by multiplying but 2 continuously and throwing out the higher digits then plugging that into the equation we need to solve... I'm not going to do that right now though because clearly my brain is not being very helful at the moment but I'll get back to it later.... to future me trying to solve this problem again: YOU GOT IT, YOURE A BOSS NOW GO CODE LIKE YOUVE NEVER CODED BEFORE!!!
